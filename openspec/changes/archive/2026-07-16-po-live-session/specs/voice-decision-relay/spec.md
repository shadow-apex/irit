## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: PO questions pause the turn and surface to voice

When the live PO session calls `AskUserQuestion`, the session SHALL pause that turn and the app SHALL surface the request to the Gemini voice layer as a structured event containing the question text and any offered options. The PO session runs in `bypassPermissions` mode, so tool-use approvals are auto-allowed and do NOT pause the turn — only `AskUserQuestion` does.

#### Scenario: PO asks a structured question mid-turn

- **WHEN** the PO calls `AskUserQuestion` during a turn
- **THEN** the SDK `canUseTool` callback fires, the PO turn is paused, and the app emits a structured question event (question + options) to the voice layer
- **AND** no new Claude process is spawned to convey the question

#### Scenario: Question is read aloud to the user

- **WHEN** the app emits a PO question event
- **THEN** Gemini reads the question and its options aloud so the user can answer by voice

### Requirement: Voice answer resumes the same turn

A voice answer to a pending PO question SHALL resolve the paused `canUseTool` callback with the user's selection so the PO continues the **same** turn and the **same** context window. The answer SHALL NOT respawn the PO or start a new run.

#### Scenario: User answers yes/no by voice

- **WHEN** the user answers a pending PO question by voice (e.g. "yes", "option 2", or a named choice)
- **THEN** the app resolves the pending callback with that selection and the PO resumes the paused turn
- **AND** the resumed turn retains all context from before the pause

#### Scenario: Multiple decisions in one question

- **WHEN** the PO's `AskUserQuestion` contains more than one question
- **THEN** the app collects a voice answer for each and resolves the callback once all are answered, preserving voice-friendly batching

### Requirement: Pending questions have a safe fallback

While a PO question is pending, the app SHALL keep the turn paused awaiting a voice answer, and SHALL provide a deterministic fallback if no answer is obtained (timeout or user abandonment) rather than hanging indefinitely.

#### Scenario: User abandons the decision

- **WHEN** a PO question remains unanswered beyond the configured wait
- **THEN** the app resolves the callback with a safe default (the PO's recommended option) and records that the default was applied

#### Scenario: Session reset with a question pending

- **WHEN** the user resets the session while a PO question is pending
- **THEN** the pending callback is settled and the paused turn is torn down without leaving an orphaned Claude process

### Requirement: PO is permitted to ask; DEV is not

The PO persona and system prompt SHALL permit and encourage asking the user via `AskUserQuestion` at genuine decision points. The DEV persona and system prompt SHALL continue to forbid mid-run questions and require sensible defaults.

#### Scenario: PO chooses to ask at a real decision point

- **WHEN** the PO reaches a decision that materially changes the PRD or scope and is not settled by the brief
- **THEN** the PO may call `AskUserQuestion` instead of silently assuming a default

#### Scenario: DEV never asks

- **WHEN** a DEV run encounters an ambiguity
- **THEN** the DEV applies a sensible default and records it, and does not pause to ask the user
